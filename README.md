## 📜Enlock - File Encryption Tool

Enlock is a simple command-line file encryption tool written in Golang. It simplifies the generation RSA key pairs, the encryption and decryption of files using AES-256, and ensures secure file transmission.

### Features

    🔐 RSA Key Pair Generation: Generate a pair of strong RSA public and private keys for secure encryption and decryption.

    🌐 AES-256 Encryption: Encrypt files or directories using a randomly generated AES-256 key.

    🔑 Passphrase Protection: Protect your private key by encrypting it with a passphrase using Argon2i Key Derivation Function (KDF).

    📦 Secure File Transmission: Use the recipient's public key to encrypt the AES-256 key, ensuring secure file transmission.

### Generated Zip File

When you use Enlock to encrypt a file or directory, it creates a zip file that contains the following:

- 📄 Encrypted File/Directory: The content of the file or directory is encrypted using AES-256.

- 🔑 AES Key File: A file containing the randomly generated AES-256 key used for encryption. This key is encrypted using the recipient's public key.

- 🌐 Public Key File: The RSA public key of the recipient.

- 🔒 Encrypted Private Key File: Your private key, encrypted with a AES-256 key generated from the user passphrase using Argon2i KDF.
